Stuff related to my [Oryx Pro](https://system76.com/laptops/oryx) from

### Lights on the front

There are 8 little lights on the front of the machine

- speedometer (CPU?)
- scroll lock?
- cap lock
- number lock
- airplane mode
- hard disk
- power adapter (yellow if not fully charged)
- power on (blinking when suspended)

### keyboard shortcuts

- `<super>-P` controls display setup (mirror/joined/built-in/external),
  but it forces you to have very small text

- `<super>` then type app name

- `<super>-t` to open new terminal
- `<ctrl>-<shift>-t` to open new tab within terminal
- `<ctrl>-<pgup/pgdn>` or `<alt>-[number]` to switch between terminal tabs
- `<super>-<tab>` to switch between apps
- `<super>-~` to switch between windows of a given app


- arrange windows: `<ctrl><super><arrow key>`
- arrange windows more thoroughly with gTile: `<super><enter (on number pad)>`
- `<shift>-<super>-<up/down arrow>` to move current application to
  workspace above or below
- `<super>-<up/down arrow>` to move to workspace above or below
- `<super>-<ctrl>-<shift>-<left/right arrow>` to move window to
  monitor to left or right (or maybe up/down arrow, depending on how
  the monitors are set up)

- holding down either the `<super>` or `<alt>` key when hovering over
  top frame of a window, you can then use the mouse to move it.

- `<ctrl>-c/v` for copy-paste except in terminal where you must use `<ctrl>-<shift>-c/v`
- clipboard indicator for clipboard with memory:
  - `<ctrl>-F9` toggle menu
  - `<ctrl>-F10` clear history (oops!)
  - `<ctrl>-F11` previous entry
  - `<ctrl>-F12` next entry

- [autokey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey) (like
  [atext](https://textexpander.com) and
  [textexpander](https://textexpander.com)): `<ctrl>-F7`

  - toggle monitoring: `<shift>-<super>-k`
  - show configuration: `<super>-k`

- `<Fn>-1` to change fan speed

- File explorer `<super>-f`
- App explorer `<super>-a`
- `<super>-m` to open/close "message tray"

- `<super>-q` seems to switch between different sound output options
  (eg laptop speakers vs those on my home display)

- Keyboard settings allows you to add further shortcuts. I created

  - `<super>-b` for browser
  - `<super>-t` for new terminal (well, this is already there for Pop,
    but I added it when I was using the standard ubuntu desktop)
  - `<super>-c` for calculator
  - `<super>-g` to open mail client (thunderbird)


### keyboard shortcuts for standard ubuntu desktop

- With standard ubuntu desktop (vs pop desktop), use
  `<super>-<arrow key>` to change size/position of a window, and use
  `<ctrl>-<alt>-<arrow key>` or `<super>-<pgup/pgdn> to switch
  workspaces

- `<super>-<shift>-<pgup/pgdn>` to move current application to a
  different workspace; `<super>-<shift>-<left/right arrow>` to move
  application to monitor to left or right

- `<ctrl>-q` to close an application; `<ctrl>-w` to close a particular
  window


### [gTile keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/gTile/gTile/blob/master/README.md#usage-with-no-interface)

- `<super>-<shift>-<number key>` for 4x4 tilings
- `<super>-<ctrl>-<number key>` for 3x3 tilings
- `<super>-<alt>-<number key>` for 2x2 tilings
- can press shortcut repeatedly to have it gradually increase in size
- `<super>-m` to toggle maximize state of window

  [add curl, 7zip, notepad++ to PATH]

Get rid of that "touch keyboard"

  - win-W -> search -> "services"
  - Scroll down to "Touch screen keyboard and handwriting panel"
  - double-click and change it from "Automatic" startup to "Manual"


Have swipe go the other way

R stuff

  When I installed devtools, it seemed like I had to separately
  install the bitops package


Equivalent of "open" on Mac is "start", for example:

  start notepad++
  start notepad++ <filename>

Install MikTeX; need to add it to your path

Git Bash

  pasting into git bash: right-click -> Edit -> paste
  (Or, shift-insert)

## Zoom

- UW-Madison zoom: <https://uwmadison.zoom.us>

### [Polling](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-meetings)

  - Need to create polls in advance: go to the page for the meeting, and create a poll at the
   bottom of the page

  - Then there should be a button at the bottom of the meeting, for
    choosing and enabling a poll.

### [Breakout rooms](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476313-Managing-Breakout-Rooms)

  - need to enable them for a meeting
  - then there should be a button at the bottom of the meeting
  - seems like people move themselves into the breakout rooms
  - when the breakout rooms are ending, there's like a 1 minute (or 30
    sec, or 2 min) notice before people are moved back (or move
    themselves back?)

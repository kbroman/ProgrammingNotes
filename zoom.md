## Zoom

- UW-Madison zoom: <https://uwmadison.zoom.us>

### [Polling](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-meetings)

  - Need to create polls in advance: go to the page for the meeting, and create a poll at the
   bottom of the page

  - Then there should be a button at the bottom of the meeting, for
    choosing and enabling a poll.

### [Breakout rooms](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476313-Managing-Breakout-Rooms)

  - need to enable them for a meeting
  - then there should be a button at the bottom of the meeting
  - seems like people move themselves into the breakout rooms
  - when the breakout rooms are ending, there's like a 1 minute (or 30
    sec, or 2 min) notice before people are moved back (or move
    themselves back?)

### Sharing screen

- To enable others to share their screen, click the arrow next to
  screen sharing, and then "advanced options"

### Annotating slides

### White board

### Recording

- If you record while sharing screen, you'll get a little thumbnail of
  the speaker in the upper-right. If you have selected a larger
  thumbnail before recording, the recording will have a larger
  thumbnail. (On my linux laptop, the thumbnail is _really_ small.)

- When I don't select "HD video" in video settings, there are black
  bars on left and right; this is also included in the recording.

### Video

- selecting "HD" means it captures a really wide angle

- selecting "original ratio" without "HD" will result in black bars on
  the right and left

- deselecting both "original ratio" and "HD" results in video being
  much more zoomed-in ... probably better

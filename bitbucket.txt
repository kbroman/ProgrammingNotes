Notes on bitbucket pull requests

- Visit https://bitbucket.org/myfriend/repo

- Click "Fork" button at top right to make my own version of it

- On command line on computer:

  git clone git@bitbucket.org:kbroman/repo.git

- Make a bunch of changes, git add; git commit; git push

  Changes are then on *my* repository but not yours

- On my version of repo at bitbucket, I click "Pull request" button

- I think you then go to your repo on git hub, view the pull request, and click "approve" and then "merge"

- Then back on your computer, "git pull"

- [There may be conflicts to deal with]

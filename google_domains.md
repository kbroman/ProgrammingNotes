## google domains

Google domains is pretty easy and inexpensive for having a custom
domain name.  I have three of them: kbroman.org, rqtl.org, and
academics.wtf.

What I particularly like is that it's easy to set up a website with
the custom domain using github pages. There are [nice instructions
here](https://dev.to/trentyang/how-to-setup-google-domain-for-github-pages-1p58).

When you purchase a domain, they try to upsell you on google workspace
for like $144/year, but you can just use email forwarding to be able
to use some special address at your custom domain. And you can even
send email from that alias.

- set up an email alias at domains.google.com -> manage -> email ->
  email forwarding
